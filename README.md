# FB Survivor
This project is used to run a family and friends NFL survivor league. As of September 2020, it is live in "production" running on a single Linode. This league was originally managed using email and Excel. The first version of the application was written in Python, Flask, and MongoDB. The second version switched to using Postgres and raw SQL queries. This version, the third, is a ground up rewrite using Django and leveraging Django's ORM.
