Hi everyone!

We are only 2 weeks away from the kickoff of the 2023 NFL Season and that means itâ€™s time to sign up to play Survivor.
The rules are the same as last year and the buy-in is still $30 for the season.

I've made some changes to the website so let me know if you have any issues.

Logins - We are using magic links.
Head to https://fbsurvivor.com/ and enter your email. We will send you a link to login.

Reminders - Control if you want email/SMS, both, or none.
Once you log in, go to https://fbsurvivor.com/reminders/ to control your settings.

As always, if you have friends or family that want to play, have them email me.
Let's make this season the biggest season yet.

I look forward to having you back. Good Luck!
